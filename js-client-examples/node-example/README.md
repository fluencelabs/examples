# Getting Started with Fluence

This is a sample Node.js application using Fluence JS Client. It exposes a calculator service written in Typescript which can be accessed from Fluence Network using Aqua language

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Start the Node.js application:

```bash
npm start
```

This should start listening to incoming particles from Fluence Network.

Try interacting with the application with some aqua:

```bash
./run_calculation.sh
```
