# yaml-language-server: $schema=schemas/app.yaml.json

# Defines what exactly is already deployed and where. This config is automatically generated by Fluence CLI after you deploy services defined in [fluence.yaml](./fluence.md) using `fluence deploy` or remove previously deployed services using `fluence remove`. In most of the cases you are not expected to modify this by hand
