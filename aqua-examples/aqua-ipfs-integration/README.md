# IPFS code execution example

> The build and deploy instructions as well as some of the Aqua code are
> outdated and the deployed services are no longer available. An updated version
> will be available soon.

This example showcases 2 things:

1. how it's possible to store .wasm modules on IPFS, then deploy them to Fluence
   as a service
2. ability to process IPFS files via a Fluence service. In this example, we get
   a size of a file
